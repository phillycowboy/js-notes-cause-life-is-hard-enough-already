Added extensions for VS Code to make life easier 

Live Server -- updates html page as you work 

CSS Peek -- click on id or class name and it will create css tag for you with f12 i think? also if you hit option it will split the html and css file on one page 
Peek: load the css file inline and make quick edits right there. (Ctrl+Shift+F12)
Go To: jump directly to the css file or open it in a new editor (F12)
Hover: show the definition in a hover over the symbol (Ctrl+hover)

color highlight-- when picking colors in css #00bdc4 it will highlight the text of the color you chose. 

bracket pair colorizer--- if you nest a js object the pairs of brackets will use different colors to determine where it starts and ends 
this might be annoying?
